Before talking about the benefit and concern of information exchange, lets me show you all the member in the network map so you know who you are exchanging information with.

    intro about information exchange
        Information exchange is a fair concept: if you SHARE then you can RECEIVE. There are two type of information you can exchange with pos_connect network that is The product information and the profit information.

    product information exchange
        Lets first talk about product information exchange which is mandatory. I know you don't like the word mandatory, but you will see it only bring benefit for you and other member. When you carry a new product, you have to define the product information. With pos_connect, there is a chance that other member in the network have already defined this information to help you. (demo)
            there are 50% of these member naming this product this way, so i choose this most popular name, in the summary section. Same thing for the crv.

            After defining this product the way you like, your product information will be used to suggest other member to import this product the same way you just did.

    profit information exchange
        The second type of information you can exchange with other member is profit information and this is optional. You share your profit information with the network and recieve the same information from the network to help you increase your profit. 

            lets see how: lets search for a product in your store. pos_connect allow you to see the network information for this product. This is the product information you saw ealier, but we concern about the profit information in this table that show you the relationship of cost, price and profit

    data security
        non-web pos store its database on local machine and you are responsible to create back up, store it somewhere safe and when things go wrong, you have to restore the system. Not an easy process.

        pos_connect is power by IBM and Amazon servers. These cooperation have the resource take care of all the task i memtion above. If your computer crash, replace it with a new one that connect to the internet and you are done.

        because all your data is online, pos_connect need the internet to access that data. for the remote control app, it need 100% internet to operate. To make your daily sale operation more reliable interm of internet disconnection, the sale app operate  offline to collect sale data.Sale app download product database offline and save all sale data temporarily offline so that it is as fast and reliable as non-web software. Sale app only need SOME internet connection to save sale data online at some point.

        As a demo, let me turn off the internet, but it does not matter the internet is on or off, sale app talk to local product database and temporarily save receipt data offline so that it is as fast and reliable as non-web pos software. Once in a while, pos_connect will remind you to save your sale data online because that is the FINAL DESTINATION of all data.
