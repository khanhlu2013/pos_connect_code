  "readme": "# gulp-cdnizer\n\n[![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url]\n\n> cdnizer plugin for [gulp](https://github.com/wearefractal/gulp)\n\nThis plugin will replace local file references in HTML and other files with CDN locations.  This allows you to work with local copies of libraries during development, and then automate switching to your CDN version when you deploy your application.\n\nFor example, if you have a development file that looks like this:\n\n```html\n<html>\n<head>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"bower_components/angular/angular.js\"></script>\n…\n```\n\nYou can use cdnizer to automatically convert it to this during your build process (*every* change here can be customized):\n\n```js\n<html>\n<head>\n<script>\nfunction cdnizerLoad(u) {\n\tdocument.write('<scr'+'ipt src=\"'+encodeURIComponent(u)+'\"></scr'+'ipt>';\n}\n</script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.2.10/angular.min.js\"></script>\n<script>if(!(angular)) cdnizerLoad(\"bower_components/angular/angular.js\");</script>\n…\n```\n\n\n### Features:\n* It's flexible without being overly complicated.\n* Handles private *and* multiple public CDNs in the same build.\n* It can use your Bower installation to determine the correct file versions—no more getting \"upgraded\" during your build.\n* Provides optional fallback scripts for failed file loading. (By default it can only handle failed JavaScript files, but it's easy to provide a custom solution.)\n\n> ## WARNING\n>\n> This plugin does not check incoming files.  Do not run it on files that you do not want modified.\n\n\n### New in version 1.0\n\ncdnizer now can load CDN data from existing `*-cdn-data` packages, currently `google-cdn-data`, `cdnjs-cdn-data`, and `jsdelivr-cdn-data`.  Now you can [configure common public CDNs with a single line](#optionsfilescommon-cdn)!\n\n\n### Possible breaking change in 1.0\n\nThe `version` field has been changed in this release.  Previously, it was the exact version as it existing within Bower.  Now, `version` is the string `major(.minor)?(.patch)?`, with any trailing (`-beta*`, `-snapshot*`, etc) information removed.  (Alpha-numeric characters that are attached to the version string, as in `1.0.0rc1`, are not stripped.)\n\nYou can still access the full version string via `versionFull`, which is not modified at all.\n\n\n\n## Index\n\n* [Usage](#usage)\n* [API](#api)\n* [Support This Project](#help-support-this-project)\n* [License](#license)\n\n\n\n## Usage\n\nFirst, install `gulp-cdnizer` as a development dependency:\n\n```shell\nnpm install --save-dev gulp-cdnizer\n```\n\nThen, add it to your `gulpfile.js`:\n\n```javascript\nvar cdnizer = require(\"gulp-cdnizer\");\n\ngulp.src(\"./src/index.html\")\n        .pipe(cdnizer({\n            defaultBase: \"//my.cdn.host/base\",\n            allowRev: true,\n            allowMin: true,\n            files: [\n                             \n\t\t\t\t// This file is on the default CDN, and will replaced with //my.cdn.host/base/js/app.js\n\t\t\t\t'js/app.js',\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t// On Google's public CDN\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\tfile: 'vendor/angular/angular.js',\n\t\t\t\t\tpackage: 'angular',\n\t\t\t\t\ttest: 'window.angular',\n\t\t\t\t\tcdn: '//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/${ version }/angular.min.js'\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t// On Firebase's public CDN\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\tfile: 'vendor/firebase/firebase.js',\n\t\t\t\t\ttest: 'window.Firebase',\n\t\t\t\t\tcdn: '//cdn.firebase.com/v0/firebase.js'\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t]\n        }))\n        .pipe(gulp.dest(\"./dist\"));\n```\n     \nAlternatively, you can just pass in the files array if you don't need to provide any options, and only have custom files:\n\n```js\ngulp.src(\"./src/index.html\")\n        .pipe(cdnizer([\n            {\n                file: 'vendor/angular/angular.js',\n                package: 'angular',\n                test: 'window.angular',\n                // use alternate providers easily\n                cdn: '//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/${ version }/angular.min.js'\n            },\n            {\n                file: 'vendor/firebase/firebase.js',\n                test: 'window.Firebase',\n                cdn: '//cdn.firebase.com/v0/firebase.js'\n            }\n        ]))\n        .pipe(gulp.dest(\"./dist\"));\n```\n\nYou can also use globs to define groups of file, and dynamic filename properties:\n\n```js\ngulp.src(\"./src/index.html\")\n        .pipe(cdnizer([{\n                file: 'vendor/angular/*.js',\n                package: 'angular',\n                test: 'window.angular',\n                cdn: '//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/${ version }/${ filenameMin }'\n            }]))\n        .pipe(gulp.dest(\"./dist\"));\n```\n\nWorks great on `url()`s in CSS files, too:\n\n```js\ngulp.src(\"./src/css/style.css\")\n        .pipe(cdnizer({\n            defaultCDNBase: '//my.cdn.url/',\n            relativeRoot: 'css',\n            files: ['**/*.{gif,png,jpg,jpeg}']\n        }))\n        .pipe(gulp.dest(\"./dist/css/\"));\n```\n\n**New in v1.0**, you can use simplified strings for common public CDNs, like so:\n\n```js\ngulp.src(\"./src/index.html\")\n        .pipe(cdnizer([\n\t\t\t\t'google:angular',          // for most libraries, that's all you'll need to do!\n\t\t\t\t'cdnjs:jquery',\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\tcdn: 'jsdelivr:yui',   // You can also use a known CDN, while…\n\t\t\t\t\tpackage: 'yui3',       // overriding the package name for Bower, and…\n\t\t\t\t\ttest: 'window.YUI'     // providing a custom fallback test\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t// you can also specify alternate files within a package:\n\t\t\t\t'jsdelivr:yui:anim-base/anim-base-min.js@3.17.2'\n            ]))\n        .pipe(gulp.dest(\"./dist\"));\n```\n\nNeed multiple files from the one package on a common CDN? Here's two solutions:\n\n```js\n// Manually list every file…\ngulp.src(\"./src/index.html\")\n        .pipe(cdnizer([\n\t\t\t\t'cdnjs:angular.js:angular.min.js',\n\t\t\t\t'cdnjs:angular.js:angular-touch.min.js',\n\t\t\t\t'cdnjs:angular.js:i18n/angular-locale_fr-fr.js'\n            ]))\n        .pipe(gulp.dest(\"./dist\"));\n\n// Or wire up a pattern:\ngulp.src(\"./src/index.html\")\n        .pipe(cdnizer([\n\t\t\t\t// matches all root angular files\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\tfile: '**/angular/*.js',\n\t\t\t\t\tcdn: 'cdnjs:angular.js:${ filenameMin }' // Yes, you can apply patterns to the filename!\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t// matches all i18n angular files\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\tfile: '**/angular/i18n/*.js',\n\t\t\t\t\tcdn: 'cdnjs:angular.js:i18n/${ filename }' // These i18n files are not minified\n\t\t\t\t}\n            ]))\n        .pipe(gulp.dest(\"./dist\"));\n```\n\n\n\n## API\n\n* [cdnizer( options | files )](#cdnizer-options--files-)\n* Shared Options\n    * [defaultCDNBase](#optionsdefaultcdnbase)\n\t* [defaultCDN](#optionsdefaultcdn)\n\t* [relativeRoot](#optionsrelativeroot)\n\t* [allowRev](#optionsallowrev)\n\t* [allowMin](#optionsallowmin)\n\t* [fallbackScript](#optionsfallbackscript)\n\t* [fallbackTest](#optionsfallbacktest)\n\t* [bowerComponents](#optionsbowercomponents)\n\t* [matchers](#optionsmatchers)\n\t* [cdnDataLibraries](#optionscdndatalibraries)\n* [Files Array](#optionsfiles)\n\t* [Type: glob](#optionsfilesglob)\n\t* [Type: common public cdn](#optionsfilescommon-cdn)\n\t* [Type: custom hashmap](#optionsfileshashmap)\n\t\t* [file](#optionsfilesfile)\n\t\t* [package](#optionsfilespackage)\n\t\t* [cdn](#optionsfilescdn)\n\t\t* [test](#optionsfilestest)\n\n\t\n### cdnizer( options | files )\n\nCreates a new cdnizer function that can be used to process file contents.  You can either pass in a configuration object, or you can pass in an array of files if you don't need to change the default shared options.\n\nSee [Usage](#usage) above for examples.\n\n\n### Options\n\n#### options.defaultCDNBase\n\nType: `String`  \nDefault: `''` *(disabled)*\n\nUsed for a default, custom CDN, usually for your own files.  This will be used in the defaultCDN property to define the default path for a CDN unless overridden.\n\n#### options.defaultCDN\n\nType: `String`  \nDefault: `'${ defaultCDNBase }/${ filepathRel }'`\n\nThis is the default pattern used for generating CDN links when one isn't provided by a specific file.\n\n#### options.relativeRoot\n\nType: `String`  \nDefault: `''`\n\nIf you are processing a file that references relative files, or is not rooted to the CDN, you **must** set `relativeRoot` to get correct results.  This relative path will be appended to the file path and the path resolved to remove relative URLs.\n\nFor example, if you have a CSS file at `style/main.css`, and you reference images as `../img/foo.png`, you should set `relativeRoot` to `'style/'`.  Now if your `defaultCDNBase` is `//example/`, the image will be resolved to `//example/img/foo.png`.\n\nIf you do *not* set `relativeRoot` when referencing relative files, your files will *not* match, and they will *not* be replaced with CDN URLs.\n\n#### options.allowRev\nType: `Boolean`\nDefault: `true`\n\nAllow for file names with `gulp-rev` appended strings, in the form of `<file>-XXXXXXXX.<ext>`.  If you are using the `gulp-rev` plugin, this will automatically match filenames that have a rev string appeneded to them.  If you are *not* using `gulp-rev`, then you can disable this by setting `allowRev` to `false`, which will prevent possible errors in accidentally matching similar file names.\n\nYou can always manually configure your globs to include an optional rev string by using the form `?(<rev glob here>)`, such as `name?(-????????).ext` for appended revs.\n\n#### options.allowMin\n\nType: `Boolean`\nDefault: `true`\n\nAllow for file names that optionally have `.min` inserted before the file extension (but after rev, if enabled).  This allows you to use the base name for a file, and have `cndizer` match the minified name.\n\n#### options.fallbackScript\n\nType: `String`  \nDefault:\n\n```html\n<script>\nfunction cdnizerLoad(u) {\n\tdocument.write('<scr'+'ipt src=\"'+encodeURIComponent(u)+'\"></scr'+'ipt>';\n}\n</script>\n```\n\nOverwrite the default fallback script.  If any of the inputs has a fallback, this script is injected before the first occurrence of `<link`, `<script`, or `</head>` in the HTML page.  Ignored for files that don't contain `<head`.\n\nIf you already have a script loader (such as yepnope or Modernizr), you can set this to an empty string and override the `fallbackTest` below to use that instead.  Of course, this won't help if you are loading *those* scripts off a CDN and they fail!\n\n#### options.fallbackTest\n\nType: `String`  \nDefault: `'<script>if(!(${ test })) cdnizerLoad(\"${ filepath }\");</script>'`\n\nOverwrite the default fallback test.  Note that all options availble to `options.files[].cdn` below are available to this template as well, along with the `options.files[].test` string.\n\n#### options.bowerComponents\n\nType: `String`  \nDefault: null\n\nIf provided, this is the directory to look for Bower components in.  If not provided, cdnizer will attempt to look for the `.bowerrc` file, and if that is not found or does not specify a directory, it falls back to `'./bower_components'`.\n\nOnce the directory is determined, the script will look for files in `<bowerComponents>/bower.json` or `<bowerComponents>/.bower.json` to try to determine the version of the installed component.\n\n#### options.matchers\n\nType: `Array`  \nDefault: `[]`\n\nArray of custom matchers. Use this to add extra patterns within which you would like to cdn-ize URLs, for example if you have such URLs in data-attributes. The matchers should include regular expressions with three matching groups:\n\n1. Leading characters\n2. The actual URL to work on, and\n3. Trailing characters, which should include the end tag if you want a fallback script injected.\n\nExample (matches the ```data-src``` attribute in ```<img>``` tags):<br />\n```js\nmatchers: [\n\t{\n\t\tpattern: /(<img\\s.*?data-src=[\"'])(.+?)([\"'].*?>)/gi,\n\t\t//groups: (       leading        )(url)(trailing)\n\t\tfallback: false\n\t}\n]\n```\n\nYou can also specify just a regular expression. In that case, fallback will default to false.\n\nEquivalent example:<br />\n```js\nmatchers: [\n\t/(<img\\s.*?data-src=[\"'])(.+?)([\"'].*?>)/gi\n]\n```\n\n#### options.cdnDataLibraries\n\nType: `Array`\nDefault: `[]`\n\nFuture-proof option to add additional `*-cdn-data` packages.  These packages *must* be in the same format as [`google-cdn-data`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/google-cdn-data).  The format is to only include the leading part of the package name, for example, `cdnjs-cdn-data` would be included as simply `'cdnjs'`.\n\n\n### options.files\n\nType: `Array`  \nDefault: (none) **required**\n\nArray of sources or objects defining sources to cdnize.  Each item in the array can be one of three types, a simple glob, a public CDN string, or object hashmap.\n\n##### options.files.«glob»\n\nWhen using a glob, if it matches a source, the `defaultCDN` template is applied.  Because there is no `test`, the script will not have a fallback.\n\n*Examples:*\n```js\n'**/*.js' // matches any .js file anywhere\n'js/**/*.js' // matches any *.js file under the js folder\n'styles/main.css' // only matches styles/main.css, possibly rev'd or min'd based on options\n'img/icon/foo??.{png,gif,jpg}' // img/icon/foo10.png, img/icon/fooAA.gif, etc\n```\n\n##### options.files.«common-cdn»\n\nPublic CDN strings make it easy to add known libraries from common public CDN repositories.  They always take the form of `'<provider>:<package>(:filename)?(@version)?'`.  Currently, cdnizer has built-in support for [Google](https://www.npmjs.org/package/google-cdn-data), [cdnjs](https://www.npmjs.org/package/cdnjs-cdn-data), and [jsDelivr](https://www.npmjs.org/package/jsdelivr-cdn-data), via the existing packages maintained by [Shahar Talmi](https://www.npmjs.org/~shahata).\n\n*Examples:*\n\n```js\n'google:jquery'                             // Note that it's all lowercase\n'google:jquery@1.0.0'                       // provide a version if you are not using Bower OR to override it\n'google:angular'\n// this loads the angular-touch file from angular on cdnjs\n'cdnjs:angular.js:angular-touch.min.js'     // you need `.js` for angular on cdnjs, but not on Google!\n'jsdelivr:angularjs'                        // jsdelivr has it different still\n```\n\nThe result of these patterns follows the following process:\n\n1. Look up the package (e.g.: `angular`) within the correct CDN's `cdn-data`.\n2. Get the URL for the package with the version set to `${ version }`, which allows dynamic replacement of the version later\n3. If we are provided an alternate filename, replace everything in the URL after `${ version }/` with the new filename. This is how you can select alternate files on the CDN.\n4. Set the `cdn` property to the URL.\n5. Grab everything after `${ version }/`—this is assumed to be the filename—and set the `file` property (i.e.: the glob pattern) to `**/«filename»`.\n6. Set the `package` property either to a known package (some known packages are mapped to their Bower package name) or to the passed-in package name.\n7. If we know the correct fallback `test` for a package, use that.  Otherwise, don't set a `test`.\n8. If a version was passed in, store that as well under the `version` property.\n\nYou can also use a common cdn while customizing the result by [using a common CDN with the `cdn` option within a hashmap](#optionsfilescdn).  You will need to do this if the CDN provider uses a different package name than Bower, or if you want to provide a fallback test (excluding a few popular libraries).\n\n> Note: you can use template strings in the `:filename` portion of the string.  However, if you do this, you'll need to overwrite the `file` property by using a hashmap (below), or it will try to match the literal string.\n> For example, you can this will match any file directly under an `angular` directory, and replace it with the CDN equivalent:\n\n> ```js\n> {\n>     file: '**/angular/*.js',\n>     cdn: 'cdnjs:angular.js:${ filenameMin }'\n> }\n> ```\n\n> If this solution gets a little too \"magic-y\", you can always just revert to manually specifying the hashmap, which might be easier.  The hashmap alternative looks like this:\n\n> ```js\n> {\n>     file: '**/angular/*.js',\n>     package: 'angular',\n>     test: 'window.angular',\n>     cdn: '//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/angular.js/${ version }/${ filenameMin }'\n> }\n> ```\n\n*Important Notes:*\n\n1. **Case matters** with these strings. Make sure you are not capitalizing the packages (such as `jQuery`, instead of `jquery`), or the output will be incorrect.\n\n2. The packages may have different names on different public CDNs.  Make sure you look up the package name on the CDN website first.  For example, AngularJS is `angular` on Google, `angular.js` on cdnjs, and `angularjs` on jsDelivr!\n\n3. You **must** provide the version if you are not using Bower to manage your packages, or if you want to override the Bower version (not recommended).\n\n4. Due to the way versions are calculated, `-beta*`, `-unstable*`, and `-snapshot*` releases will not work with common CDNs.  This means only projects with standard 1-, 2-, or 3-part version strings will work.\n\n5. The CDN packages available are limited to those included in the `cdn-data` packages, which means they might not always be up-to-date with the latest public packages.  However, the version information is not used at all by cdnizer, which means you can update to the latest version faster.\n\n##### options.files.«hashmap»\n\nThe object hashmap gives you full control, using the following properties:\n\n> ##### options.files[].file\n\n> Type: `String`  \n> Default: (none) **required**\n\n> Glob to match against for the file to cdnize.  All properties within this object will be applied to all files that match the glob.  Globs are matched in a first-come, first-served basis, where only the first matched object hashmap is applied.\n\n> ##### options.files[].package\n\n> Type: `String`  \n> Default: (none)\n\n> Bower package name for this source or set of sources.  By providing the package name, cdnizer will look up the version string of the *currently installed* Bower package, and provide it as a property to the `cdn` string.  This is done by looking for either the `bower.json` or `.bower.json` file within your Bower components directory.\n\n> The benefit of doing it this way is that the version used from the CDN *always* matches your local copy.  It will never automatically be updated to a newer patch version without being tested.\n\n> ##### options.files[].cdn\n\n> Type: `String`  \n> Default: `options.defaultCDN`\n\n> This it the template for the replacement string. It can either be a custom CDN string, or it can be a common public CDN string, using the same format as a [public CDN string](#optionsfilescommon-cdn) above.\n\n> *Common Public CDN String:*\n\n> Load in the default data for an existing common public CDN, using the format `'<provider>:<package>(:filename)?(@version)?'`. You can then customize the settings for the package, by overriding any property in this section (e.g.: providing a fallback `test`, a different `package` name, or even matching a different `file`).\n\n> *Custom CDN String:*\n\n> Provide a custom CDN string, which can be a simple static string, or contain one or more underscore/lodash template properties to be injected into the string:\n\n> * `versionFull`: if [`package`](#optionsfilespackage) was provided, this is the complete version currently installed version from Bower.\n> * `version`: if `package` was provided, this is the `major(.minor)?(.patch)?` version number, minus any trailing information (such as `-beta*` or `-snapshot*`).\n> * `major`: if `package` was provided, this is the major version number.\n> * `minor`: if `package` was provided, this is the minor version number.\n> * `patch`: if `package` was provided, this is the patch version number.\n> * `defaultBase`: the default base provided above.  Note that this will *never* end with a trailing slash.\n> * `filepath`: the full path of the source, as it exists currently.  There is no guarantee about the whether this contains a leading slash or not, so be careful.\n> * `filepathRel`: the relative path of the source, guaranteed to *never* have a leading slash. The path is also processed against `options.relativeRoot` above, to try and remove any parent directory path elements.\n> * `filename`: the name of the file, without any parent directories\n> * `filenameMin`: the name of the file, *without* any rev tags (if `allowRev` is true), but *with* a `.min` extension added.  This won't add a min if there is one already.\n> * `package`: the Bower package name, as provided above.\n\n> ##### options.files[].test\n\n> Type: `String`  \n> Default: (none)\n\n> If provided, this string will be evaluated within a javascript block.  If the result is truthy, then we assume the CDN resource loaded properly.  If it isn't, then the original local file will be loaded.  This is ignored for files that don't get the [fallback script](#optionsfallbackscript).\n\n> This snippet will be inserted *exactly* as provided.  If the package fails to load from the CDN, the global variable won't exist, so you need to check for it's existence on an *existing* global object.  Usually this will be `window`, which you'll see through most of the examples here.\n\n> When using a common public CDN, some popular packages come with fallback tests.
